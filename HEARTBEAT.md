# Tech & AI Research Heartbeat

**For automated research updates, use this checklist during heartbeats:**

## Session Start / Memory Recovery
- [ ] Read MEMORY.md
- [ ] Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (today's log)
- [ ] Check today-state.json for context version

## Nightly Build (8:00 AM IST)
If 8 AM IST and not yet run today:
1. Read memory/nightly-build-state.json for ideas queue
2. Pick ONE friction point to fix
3. Build the solution
4. Update nightly-build-log.md with what was built
5. Send Sahil a morning report
6. Update state.json (lastRun, buildsCompleted)

### Current Build Ideas:

**Note:** This is a manual checklist. For fully automated twice-daily research,
I can run research for you now and you can request updates anytime by asking:
"Research latest tech news" or "What happened in AI today?"
